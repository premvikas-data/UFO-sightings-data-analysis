# UFO Sightings Data Analysis 👽

This project explores and analyses over 80,000 UFO sightings reported globally from 1949 to 2014. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical hypothesis testing, we uncover trends, anomalies, and patterns hidden within the dataset.

## Project Highlights
- 📊 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (handling missing values)
- 🌍 Geographic mapping of sightings by latitude and longitude
- 🛸 Analysis of UFO shapes and their frequency trends over decades
- 📅 Seasonal trends and regional analysis of sightings
- 📈 Hypothesis testing using Chi-squared test (Day vs Night sightings)
- 🔥 Key findings include: sightings more common at night, USA leading in sightings, and 'Light' as the most common UFO shape.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Geo Mapping with Plotly
- Statistical Testing with Scipy

## Data Source
- UFO Sightings Public Dataset

## Future Enhancements
- Predictive modeling for UFO sighting likelihood
- Deeper NLP analysis on description texts
- Temporal-spatial anomaly detection
